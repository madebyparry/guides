Having a backup of your WordPress website is crucial. It's like having an insurance policy for your online store â€“ in case of unexpected issues like plugin conflicts, theme malfunctions, or even accidental deletions, a backup allows you to restore your Mental Goose Clothing Co. website to a previous working state. This guide will show you how to create backups and restore them using the popular All-In-One WP Migration plugin.

**Backup Etiquette: A Few Do's and Don'ts**

* **Do schedule regular backups.** Aim for weekly or bi-weekly backups, depending on how often you update your site. 
* **Don't rely solely on your web hosting provider's backups.** While some offer backup services, it's best to have your own copy for added security.
* **Do store backups in multiple locations.** Save a copy on your local computer and consider an additional cloud storage service for extra protection.
* **Don't store backups within your website's directory.** This could lead to both the website and backup being lost if something goes wrong.

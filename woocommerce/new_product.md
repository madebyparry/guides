   - **General:**

     - **Product type:** WooCommerce offers various product types. For most clothing items, "Simple product" is the default choice.
     - **Regular price:** Enter the regular price of your product.
     - **Sale price (optional):** If you're offering a discount, enter the sale price here.

   - **Inventory:**

     - **Manage stock:** Enable this option to track your product inventory.
     - **SKU:** Enter a unique identifier for your product (optional but recommended).

   - **Shipping:**  
     **This is where we'll set the shipping category.** WooCommerce allows you to group products based on size, weight, or other factors to determine shipping costs.
     Click on the "Shipping class" dropdown menu and choose a relevant category (e.g., "Clothing") or create a new one if needed.

4. **Add Images:**  
   Compelling product images are crucial for online sales. Click on "Set product image" to upload your main product image. You can also add a gallery of additional images to showcase your product from different angles.

   - In the "Name" field, enter "Size" (or another relevant attribute name).

   - Now, we need to link this attribute to the product variations. Click on "Variations" and then "Create variations from all attributes." WooCommerce will automatically generate a variation for each size you entered.

   - **Optional:** You can customize pricing or inventory for each size variation here.

1. **Finalize and Publish:**  
   Once you've filled in all the necessary details, scroll down and click on the "Publish" button to make your product live on your website.
